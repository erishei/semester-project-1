## About:
This is my contribution for the Semester project. It's a page for a science museum,  
catering to youths and also families with children. The thought here is to make a page that caters  
to these two juxtaposing target audiences without being very obvious or cliché.

## Requirements
1. The site must have a design that appeals to the target audience.
2. The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
3. Compositional principles, typography, and colour schemes must be considered.
4. Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
5. The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
6. The site should download quickly and not be overly “heavy”. Images should be at most
   200kb.
7. The site should consider WCAG principles, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation,
   and colour usage.
8. The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on various devices.
9. The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of
   meta tags and alt text).

## Technologies-used:  
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js / OSM generator (Used for the map on information page)
- Notion.so

## Other Tools:
- Figma for the design process
- GitHub for the repo, project board and roadmap.
- WebStorm for coding.
- Netlify for deployment.
- Thomas Eikhaugens' brains for bug fixes and issues.
- Unsplash was used for the image on events page. 
- Social icons were found on [iconpacks.net](https://www.iconpacks.net/social-media-icons.html)

## Features: 
- The site features live links to all the pages that have been built.  
- For screens up to 850px there is a functioning hamburger menu built with javascript.
- On the Information page there is an interactive map in the location box made using OSM generator.
- Notion was used to write articles for The Science Journal page. 
- Netlify deployment makes it so the subscription form found on the bottom of each page is functioning.
- The tiniest bit of CSS animations on the h1 on each page. 
- Aria labels are used for WCAG compliance. 

### Featured pages on this project:
- Home/Index
- Events
- Exhibitions
- Practical information
- Booking/Tickets
- Contact/Support
- The Science Journal
- About 

## Process 
We started this project by mapping it out during our Project Methodology CA.
That process consisted of creating a GitHub project with a board and roadmap.
I chose GitHub as it's a tool I'm already familiar with and it made sense to keep everything in one place.
Though I felt I had planned everything out very well, even allowing for breaks and unforeseen issues,  
I ended up spending much longer on the designing process than I had thought. 
In part because of illness during the first two weeks but also indecision with the design itself.

### Design process:
I did not follow a typical linear design process. There are a few mid-fi wireframes,  
but mostly the site has been designed in high-fidelity as I find it much easier to visualize that way.  

### Coding process: 
Having learned a few things from the previous HTML/CSS CA, I started this process much more confidently.  
I started with the HTML and CSS for the header and footer. The two having a separate CSS file to apply with the DRY principle.

Everything is created using mobile-first and then desktop, making adjustments for tablet etc. in between.

All but one of the images used are from the assets provided with the assignment brief.

The last thing created was the hamburger menu. I had not made it in my previous project  
and with a little help decided to make it here using js. 

## Reflection: 
I was a little rusty when starting, so the later pages (after the homepage) are much more well made and  
are more reactive. With more time I would like to remake the main part of the homepage.

Although I'm not a designer, and it is not my strong suit I felt I ended up with something ok, and it's been  
challenging and fun to code.

There is definitely room for improvements in certain areas. But all in all I feel much more confident in  
this project vs. the first one.
